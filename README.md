# pentest_scripts
some useful scripts for penetration tests


## linux-get-programm-to-port.sh 
This is a netstat implementation to find used ports from the /proc/net/ files. I've found a few systems where netstat was not
installed of only the restricted version from busybox. Currently it doesn't support the tcp_diag interface, only the /proc system.

For pretty output use.
```
./linux-get-programm-to-port.sh | column -t -s $'\t'
```

## detectPorts.sh
Hacky version of netstat, only lists open ports bound to all all interfaces. Easy to understand for modifications in special cases.

## exploit-db-paper-download
Download file to store all pdf papers from exploit-db locally.

## getRanges.rb
Calculate ranges of list of numbers. For example if you have a file with 
```
1
2
3
5
6
7
```
you can use the script
```
./getRanges.rb < nummerFile
```
to get
```
[1-3]
[5-7]
```
