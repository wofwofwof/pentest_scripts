some useful scripts for penetration tests


## linux-get-programm-to-port.sh 
This is a netstat implementation to find used ports from the /proc/net/ files. I've found a few systems where netstat was not
installed of only the restricted version from busybox. Currently it doesn't support the tcp_diag interface, only the /proc system.

For pretty output use.
```
./linux-get-programm-to-port.sh | column -t -s $'\t'
```

## detectPorts.sh
Hacky version of netstat, only lists open ports bound to all all interfaces. Easy to understand for modifications in special cases.
